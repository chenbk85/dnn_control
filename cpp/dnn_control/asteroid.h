class Asteroid {
    /*
     * This class represents the dynamics and gravity of an asteroid shaped as a rigid ellipsoid having different
     * rotational properties along its three principal inertia axis (Ix, Iy, Iz).
     *
     * For the angular velocity dynamics the analytical solution in terms of Jacobi elliptic functions is used (Implementation
     * largely inspired from Landau Lifshitz Mechanics paragraph 37). We thus assume w_y(-t_bias) = 0. So we only are free to specify two
     * more initial conditions and we do so by assigning kinetic energy and angular momentum. As a result the user is not free to specify
     * the initial angular velocity, but only the values of the two prime integrals. He does so by defining an angular velocity vector in
     * the constructor, this is used only to compute kinetic energy and rotational momentum, the second of its components (w_y) will thus be disregarded
     * as 0 will instead be used.
     *
     * Implementation for the gravity is largely inspired from Dario Cersosimo EVALUATION OF NOVEL HOVERING STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE GRAVITY-TRACTOR DEFLECTION MERITS paragraph 3.2.2.
     *
     * Implementation for the nearest point on the surface is largely ported from David Eberly "Distance from a Point to an Ellipse, an Ellipsoid, or a Hyperellipsoid".
