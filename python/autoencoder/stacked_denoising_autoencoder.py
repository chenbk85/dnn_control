 This tutorial introduces stacked denoising auto-encoders (SdA) using Theano.

 Denoising autoencoders are the building blocks for SdA.
 They are based on auto-encoders as the ones used in Bengio et al. 2007.
 An autoencoder takes an input x and first maps it to a hidden representation
 y = f_{\theta}(x) = s(Wx+b), parameterized by \theta={W,b}. The resulting
 latent representation y is then mapped back to a "reconstructed" vector
 z \in [0,1]^d in input space z = g_{\theta'}(y) = s(W'y + b').  The weight
 matrix W' can optionally be constrained such that W' = W^T, in which case
 the autoencoder is said to have tied weights. The network is trained such
 that to minimize the reconstruction error (the error between x and z).

 For the denosing autoencoder, during training, first x is corrupted into
 \tilde{x}, where \tilde{x} is a partially destroyed version of x by means
 of a stochastic mapping. Afterwards y is computed as before (using
 \tilde{x}), y = s(W\tilde{x} + b) and z as s(W'y + b'). The reconstruction
 error is now measured between z and the uncorrupted input x, which is
 computed as the cross-entropy :
      - \sum_{k=1}^d[ x_k \log z_k + (1-x_k) \log( 1-z_k)]

    A stacked denoising autoencoder model is obtained by stacking several
    dAs. The hidden layer of the dA at layer `i` becomes the input of
    the dA at layer `i+1`. The first layer dA gets as input the input of
    the SdA, and the hidden layer of the last dA represents the output.
    Note that after pretraining, the SdA is dealt with as a normal MLP,
    the dAs are only used to initialize the weights.
